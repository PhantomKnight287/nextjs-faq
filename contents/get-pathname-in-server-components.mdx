title: Get pathname in server components

It is likely that you don't need to get the pathname, or you should use a client component instead.

- Because layout server components are not recomputed when you navigate in the pages under it, it is
  impossible to determine the pathname in any layout components.

- The pathname can be hardcoded if you need it in page components.

- If you need the pathname in a reused component, add a `pathname` prop to it and pass the hardcoded
  value from the page components to it.

If you really, _really_ want to get the pathname in any server components, you can use
[`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and get the pathname from
relevant HTTP headers.
