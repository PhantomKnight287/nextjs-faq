Route handlers follow completely different syntax compared to the `pages/api` directory. You use
`req.json()` instead, just like how you `res.json()` after `fetch()`ing a URL.

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  console.log(body);
  return new Response("OK");
}
```
