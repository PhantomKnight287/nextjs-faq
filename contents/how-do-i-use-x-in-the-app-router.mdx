> How do I use X in the app router?

- **`next-auth`**: Read [this discussion](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/5647).

- **tRPC**: See [this sample repo](https://github.com/trpc/next-13), but to be fair I don't
  recommend using tRPC with the app router.

- **UI libraries**: See
  [this section](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#third-party-packages) in
  the documentation. For libraries that have a provider,
  [this section](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#rendering-third-party-context-providers-in-server-components)
  might be relevant.
