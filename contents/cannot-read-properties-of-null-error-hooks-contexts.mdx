A likely cause is that you're using a hook/context in a server component in the app router. They can
only be used inside client components. See
<Question id="when-is-a-component-a-client-component-in-the-app-router" /> for when a component is
considered a client component. Most likely, you'll need to add a `"use client"` directive somewhere.

If you didn't use the hook yourself, that means a third-party library you used uses the hook but
didn't mark it as a client component. Refer to
[Third party packages](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#third-party-packages)
for how to fix this.
