title: When is a component a client component, in the app router?
messageContent:
  "A component is a client component when it has `use client` or it is imported to a client
  component. Hence, a client component layout.tsx doesn't disqualify children page.tsx files from
  being server components. See more [here](<link>)."

> When is a component a client component, in the app router?

- When it is explicitly marked as a client component, using the `"use client"` directive, or
- When it is imported to a client component.

In all other cases, the component is a server component.

Do note that when a component X is imported to a client component Y, X is rendered as a client
component for that case only, and is still a server component by default elsewhere, unless you
explicitly used the `"use client"` directive.
