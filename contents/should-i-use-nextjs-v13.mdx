title: Should I use Next.js v13?

> Should I migrate my app to Next.js v13, or should I keep using v12 until v13 is stable?

Version 13 _is_ stable. You can still use the `pages` directory in Next.js v13 normally. The new app
router is not stable, but it is not required; you don't have to use it in v13.

Please upgrade to Next.js v13, as it's generally a bad idea to keep using outdated software. You
also won't receive as much help in the Discord server if you keep using version 12. Refer to
[the migration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading#upgrading-from-12-to-13) on more info on how
to upgrade.

For whether or not you should use the new app router, refer to
<Question id="should-i-use-the-app-router" />.

The only major case where you should not use Next.js v13 is if you must use React v17 or lower,
since Next.js v13 requires React v18. In this case I recommend the following:

- Migrate your app to React v18 as soon as possible, and upgrade to Next.js v13 right after that

- If you can't use React v18 because of a dependency, make a feature request to the said dependency
  asking them to upgrade to React v18, or find an alternative.
