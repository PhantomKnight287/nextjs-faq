The best platform to host your nextjs application is [Vercel](https://vercel.com) but if you don't want to host on vercel then you can take a look at [these official code examples](https://github.com/orgs/nextjs/repositories) to host your application on other platforms like Render, Fly.io etc.

<Callout type="warn" >
You cannot host long running servers like Socketio on Vercel. For that, you need to host them on a serverful platform like Render or Fly.io

</Callout>

You can also self host your applicaiton on your VPS but you need to know docker. You can follow [these docs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker) for docker configuration and [these docs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker-multi-env) for multiple docker env like staging, production etc.

You can use long running tasks if you self host your application using docker.

Below are some list of platforms to host your nextjs application:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Render](https://render.com)
- [Railway](https://railway.app)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
