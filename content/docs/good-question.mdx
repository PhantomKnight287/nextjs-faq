Are you wondering why no one answer your question? Normally, you would get at least one response after posting it for 12 hours. If you don't, consider improving the quality of your question or find a better place to ask.

To be fair. Helpers are human, they love skimming the help fourm and find easy questions to answer.

## Wrong Place

If you ask DevOP related questions in Next.js Community, e.g "Vercel CI/CD give errors for ...". No matter how good and detailed your question is, people might not answer it as they are not familar with the topic you're asking.

Hence, refer to a better place to ask when you believe your question is detailed enough.

## Messy Code Blocks

Sending your code through a photo or raw text is a terrible decision, it's extremely hard to read. Please read this guide about [formatting your message](/non-nextjs-questions#how-do-i-format-my-message-nicely) for learning how to make your message prettier.

## Read the Docs

Don't misunderstand this, we are willing to help beginners. However, we are not your personal GPT. Please search for existing solutions or read the Next.js documentation before asking your question.

## Super long code blocks

No, stop it. We are not interested on reading your long code block with hundreds of lines and find the line which causes problem. Provide a minimal reproducible repository instead.

## Lack of Details and Explanations

Asking questions without providing any details, like ("Why it is not working?????" or "pls help me"). You may expect a magician can solve your problem. However, we can't help you unless you have provided some useful information.

For questions about facing bug/errors, please provide a minimal reproducible repository as well as CodeSandbox url so that we can help you without opening an editor.

Always elaborate your question, nobody know what do you mean by "Not working" nor "Nothing happen". Describe the expected behaviour, and the actual behaviour you're getting.

In addition, you can provide some contexts, such as what've you done so far. This helps us on indicating the cause of your problem.

## Dump it

You can actually dump your thread, which may increase the possibility that someone respond your question.
