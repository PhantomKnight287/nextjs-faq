Best auth library depends on your usecase and capabilities. If you want to control all the data of you users, you can use something like [Next-Auth(now Auth.js)](https://authjs.dev) or [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com). If you want a hosted solution then you can use [Clerk](https://clerk.com) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

Storing user data like passwords comes with its own complications. Please make sure you follow all necessary guidelines to store user data. You can follow [Owasp Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) on password storage.
