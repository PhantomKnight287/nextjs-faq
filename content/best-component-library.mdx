There is no "best" component library. If you want to fully customize your application, you can use [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) which uses tailwind and Radix UI. You can also use something like Chakra UI or Material UI.

Below are some list of component libraries:

- [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
- [NextUI](https://nextui.org)
