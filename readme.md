This is a collection of my answers for commonly asked questions on the Next.js Discord server.

I should probably improve site-wide navigation, but for now, the answers are at `/:id` where `id` is
the slug of the answer file in `contents`. For example,
https://nextjs-discord-common-questions.joulev.dev/should-i-use-the-app-router.

You can also go to https://nextjs-discord-common-questions.joulev.dev and have the PRNG redirect you
to a random answer.
